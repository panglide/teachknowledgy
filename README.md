# Teachknowledgy
Teachknowldey is a data management tool for the classroom teacher.  
This is intended to be a fully realized internet based application.  
It is built upon the Laravel framework and there are plans to return to this project and 
rework the code base to more distinclty seperate the front end and back end into a more API/Microservices 
architecture.  This version is meant to serve as a demo or proof of concept.
